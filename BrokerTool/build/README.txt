STRONGLY recommended to run in command prompt to see server and client status.
For running in cmd:
1. Run cmd.exe as administrator
2. Go to directory where server's and client's jars located (use "cd" command )
3. Write "java -jar server-20170819.jar" to start server.
   Then in new cmd window write "java -jar client-20170819.jar" to start client's jar
4. DONE!
